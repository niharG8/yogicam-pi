Hardware Setup:
Get the RPi connected to the internet via ethernet or a USB wifi adapter. Connect the pan servo PWM input to GPIO #18 and the tilt servo PWM input to GPIO #23. Using a 2A power supply, connect the +5V to the RPi +5V GPIO pin and the GND to a GND pin on the GPIO header. Connect both servos to the same power source, but make sure not to use a different GPIO ground pin, in order to avoid sinking current through RPi traces. Connect the webcam to the USB port. It will be powered through the RPi. 


Software Setup:
A fully functional RPi SD Card image is provided. For setup from the ground up, follow the directions below. 
Install all software above. Set up noip2 and servoblaster to auto-start using the startnoip2 and start_servoblaster startup scripts. Just copy the scripts to /etc/init.d/ and chmod +x. 

Copy ptz.cgi to /usr/lib/cgi-bin (or whatever apache is set up to use for cgi-bin)

Set up /etc/apache2/apache2.conf by adding the following lines: 
LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_http.so

ProxyPass /cgi-bin/ !
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/

ProxyPassReverse /cgi-bin/ !
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/


Ensure port 80 and 8080 are forwarded to the RPi from the router configuration. Of course, this requires a static DHCP address for the RPi, or a preferred address. 

To start mjpg-streamer, use the start_yogicam.sh script, which will start the built-in mjpg-streamer server on port 8080 to stream the video and more. The html files for this server are at /var/ww/. The apache reverse proxy will automatically forward all requests to directories other than /cgi-bin/ to port 8080. Requests to /cgi-bin/ will be served from the /cgi-bin/ directory on the Pi. 


To view the video, just navigate a web browser to http://yourdomain.no-ip.biz/index.html. The direct stream is at http://yourdomain.no-ip.biz/?action=stream. 

To view on Android, install the tinyCam Monitor app, and through Developer Settings, import the custom_vendors.xml file. This will allow you to add a camera of make Yogicam, model Yogicam Advanced PTZ, which supports streaming video and pan/tilt operation. Pan and tilt operation is handled by the ptz.cgi python script, which moves the pan and tilt servos a given amount for "up", "down", "left", and "right" commands from the app. All commands can also be entered into a browser or curl as ".../cgi-bin/ptz.cgi?move=up", where any direction can be given.
